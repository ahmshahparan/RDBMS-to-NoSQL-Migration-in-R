###Objectibe:
The object of this assignment is to develop understanding of data storage and retrieval mechanism for a NoSQL database. For this conversion, I have chosen the SQL database of my own. Database ER diagram is illustrated below. Amongst the NoSQL database, I have chosen mongoDB for the migration.

###Required Libraries:
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# SQL Database Connector
library(RMySQL)

#Mongolite Database Connector
library(mongolite)
```

###MySQL 
Here we pull the data down from MySQL:
```{r}
mydb <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='ahmshahparan', password='11223344', host='db4free.net')
dbSendQuery(mydb, "USE ahmshahparan;")

customers <- dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * FROM CDW_SAPP_CUSTOMER;")
branches <- dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * FROM CDW_SAPP_BRANCH;")
transactions <- dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * FROM CDW_SAPP_CREDITCARD;")

#Disconnect and detach RMySQL to prevent masking of functions below
dbDisconnect(mydb)
detach("package:RMySQL", unload=TRUE)
```
Data can be also downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ahmshahparan/SQL-to-NoSQL-Migration-in-R/tree/master/MySQL-Database).

###MongoDB
Once we pull the movie ratings from mySQL, we connect to a MongoDB, and use the count() function to make sure the database is empty.
```{r}
customersNoSQL <- mongo(collection = 'CDW_SAPP_CUSTOMER', db = 'ahmshahparan', url = "mongodb://ahmshahparan:11223344@ds263619.mlab.com:63619/ahmshahparan")

branchesNoSQL <- mongo(collection = 'CDW_SAPP_BRANCH', db = 'ahmshahparan', url = "mongodb://ahmshahparan:11223344@ds263619.mlab.com:63619/ahmshahparan")

transactionsNoSQL <- mongo(collection = 'CDW_SAPP_CREDITCARD', db = 'ahmshahparan', url = "mongodb://ahmshahparan:11223344@ds263619.mlab.com:63619/ahmshahparan")

customersNoSQL$count("{}")
branchesNoSQL$count("{}")
transactionsNoSQL$count("{}")
```

###Data Migration
From here we insert the ratings table into Mongo and run a count() to make sure the data was uploaded.
```{r}
customersNoSQL$insert(customers)
branchesNoSQL$insert(branches)
transactionsNoSQL$insert(transactions)

customersNoSQL$count("{}")
branchesNoSQL$count("{}")
transactionsNoSQL$count("{}")
```
The data is successfully migrated and can be queried now.


###Cleanup
Drop the created tables from Mongo if needed and the connection through mongolite automatically disconnects when the connection is removed.
```{r}
customersNoSQL$drop()
branchesNoSQL$drop()
transactionsNoSQL$drop()

customersNoSQL$count("{}")
branchesNoSQL$count("{}")
transactionsNoSQL$count("{}")

rm(customersNoSQL)
rm(branchesNoSQL)
rm(transactionsNoSQL)
```

###Comparison
* SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

* NoSQL uses documents that have flexible schema. Each instance can have a fluid number of named schemas, for example, customers can be set up without having to change the schema.

* NoSQL allows easy migration of data because of the easy and flexible schema. No-SQL databases such as MongoDB also scale better and have higher performance compared to SQL databases.

* A disadvantage that I see over SQL databases is that it is harder to view the data in its entirety. We are so used to seeing data in a tabular form. We cannot directly see what the table looks like in its column names, typical values, etc. 

* Overall the conversion process was smooth. The more difficult part was to identify proper database storage method (SQL vs. NoSQL) and proper database structure.
